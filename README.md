# OLX Hunter Bot 🏠🔎

A Telegram bot that monitors **OLX** housing listings against user-defined
filters and sends **instant notifications** when a new matching listing appears —
or when the price of one you've already seen changes.

Built with **NestJS + TypeScript**, **Telegraf** (long polling, no webhook) and
**Redis** for all state. Runs as an isolated Docker Compose stack with **no
inbound ports** — it only makes outbound calls to Telegram and OLX.

---

## Features

- **Multiple independent search profiles per user** — e.g. "apartment for me"
  + "garage as investment" — each polling and notifying on its own.
- **Filters:** city, district, price range, area range (m²), owner-only vs.
  include realtors.
- **New-listing + price-change alerts** with title, price, area, district, link
  and thumbnail.
- **Allowlist access control** — only permitted Telegram user IDs can use the bot.
- **Resilient by design** — dedup state lives in Redis (restart-safe); one
  user's error never stops polling for everyone else; the scraper never throws
  into the loop.
- **Scraping etiquette** — jittered poll intervals, rotating realistic
  User-Agents, retry-with-backoff, and identical searches deduped into one OLX
  fetch per cycle.

## Bot commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/start`, `/help` | Welcome + how-to |
| `/newsearch` | Step-by-step wizard: city → district → price → area → owner toggle |
| `/mysearches` | List your profiles with inline **Pause / Resume / Delete** buttons |
| `/pause <id>` | Pause a profile (keeps its data) |
| `/resume <id>` | Resume a paused profile |
| `/forgetme` | Delete **all** your profiles and stored data |
| `/cancel` | Abort the `/newsearch` wizard at any step |

User-facing copy is **Ukrainian** by default (targets **OLX.ua**).

## Architecture

NestJS modules, roughly one per concern:

```
src/
├── config/           # typed env parsing (one place for defaults/validation)
├── telegram/         # bot commands, /newsearch wizard, allowlist, notifications
├── olx-scraper/      # fetch + parse listings, behind the OlxScraper interface
├── search-profiles/  # profile model + CRUD/lifecycle service
├── persistence/      # single Redis client + repository-style access
└── scheduler/        # the jittered polling loop (dedup → diff → notify)
```

**Data model (Redis only — no SQL, by design).** The data is flat (dedup + flat
filter profiles), so a relational DB would be over-engineering.

| Key (`{p}` = `REDIS_KEY_PREFIX`) | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `{p}:profile:{id}` | JSON string | a `SearchProfile` |
| `{p}:user:{userId}:profiles` | Set | a user's profile ids |
| `{p}:profiles:all` | Set | every profile id (scheduler iterates this) |
| `{p}:seen:{profileId}` | **Hash** `listingId → lastPrice` | dedup **and** price-change detection |

The seen-**hash** (not a plain set) is the key trick: a stored price differing
from the freshly-scraped price is exactly the signal for a "price changed"
re-notification. Seen state is updated **only after a successful send**, so a
crash mid-notify re-tries next cycle instead of silently swallowing the alert.

**First-poll priming.** When a profile is first polled, its current matches are
recorded silently (no messages) so activating a search doesn't blast you with
every listing that already exists — you only hear about genuinely new ones from
then on.

### The scraper abstraction

Everything talks to the `OlxScraper` interface via the `OLX_SCRAPER` token, so
the fetch strategy can change without touching the rest of the app. Two
implementations ship, selected by the `SCRAPER` env var:

- **`mock`** (default) — deterministic fake listings, **no network**. Use it to
  try the whole pipeline (wizard, dedup, notifications, price changes) end-to-end
  without touching OLX. The mock rotates in a "new" listing and drifts one price
  every ~10 minutes so you can see both alert types fire.
- **`http`** — real **OLX.ua** scraping (axios + Cheerio; parses the embedded
  `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON, falling back to HTML cards). ⚠️ **Best-effort:** OLX has
  no public API and its markup/params drift, so treat the URL builder and parsers
  as a starting point to tune against the live site. Datacenter IPs (like the
  droplet) may be rate-limited — set `HTTP_PROXY_URL` to route through a proxy if
  needed. Any failure returns `[]`, never a throw.

## Local development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 20
- A running Redis (locally: `docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine`)
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- Your numeric Telegram user id (from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))

### Steps
```bash
# 1. Install deps
npm install

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env
#   set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and ALLOWED_USER_IDS (at minimum)
#   keep SCRAPER=mock to try it without hitting OLX
#   set REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379 for a local redis

# 3. Run (watch mode)
npm run start:dev
```

Then message your bot: `/start` → `/newsearch`. With `SCRAPER=mock` you'll start
getting (fake) notifications within a poll cycle.

> Tip: lower `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (e.g. `20000`) while developing to see alerts
> quickly.

## Deployment

Runs fully isolated under `/opt/olx-bot/`, separate from the existing `aurora`
stack: its own Compose project, its own bridge network, its own Redis volume,
**no published ports**.

There is **no `.env` file on the droplet** and **no manual bootstrap step**.
Secrets live only in GitHub Actions Secrets and are injected into the container
at deploy time (see below). Just configure the secrets once and push to `main`.

### Secrets stay off the droplet's disk

Instead of a plaintext `.env` sitting in `/opt/olx-bot/`, the deploy passes
`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` / `HTTP_PROXY_URL` into the deploy
shell over the encrypted SSH channel (via stdin — never as `ps`-visible args and
never to a file), and Compose's pass-through `environment:` hands them to the
container at `up`. The deploy also `rm -f`s any legacy `.env`.

> **Caveat, stated honestly:** env vars given to a container are still recorded
> by Docker in its container config on disk (`docker inspect`, root-only) — that
> is inherent to any containerized env var. This design removes the standalone,
> backup-prone `.env` file and centralizes rotation in GitHub; it does **not**
> defend against a root-level compromise of the droplet. For that tier, use an
> external secrets manager.

Updating the allowlist = edit the `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` **GitHub secret** and re-run
the deploy (Actions → Run workflow). No SSH, no file edit.
(If the group turns over often, the allowlist can move into a Redis Set later —
same infra, no redeploy. See `src/telegram/allowlist.middleware.ts`.)

---

## CI/CD — automated deploy (GitHub Actions → DigitalOcean)

[`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) runs on every push
and PR:

- **`build`** (all pushes + PRs): `npm ci` + `npm run build` — the typecheck gate.
- **`deploy`** (push to `main` or manual **Run workflow**): `rsync`es the repo to
  `/opt/olx-bot/`, then runs `docker compose up -d --build` on the droplet and a
  post-deploy health check that fails the run if a container crash-loops.

No container registry — the droplet builds its own image, matching the `aurora`
pattern. Deploys are serialized (`concurrency`) so two pushes can't collide.

### Required GitHub repository secrets

Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → **New repository secret**:

| Secret | Required | What it is |
|---|:--:|---|
| `DO_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | ✅ | Private key (full PEM contents) of a deploy keypair whose **public** key is in the droplet user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` |
| `DO_HOST` | ✅ | Droplet IP or hostname |
| `DO_USER` | ✅ | SSH user (`root`, or a deploy user in the `docker` group) |
| `DO_SSH_PORT` | — | SSH port if not `22` |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | ✅ | Bot token — injected into the container at deploy, never stored on the droplet |
| `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | ✅ | Comma-separated allowed Telegram ids — same injection |
| `HTTP_PROXY_URL` | — | Outbound proxy for the scraper, if the droplet IP is blocked |

### One-time droplet setup

```bash
# 1. On your machine: generate a dedicated deploy key (no passphrase)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ./olx_deploy_key -C "olx-bot-ci" -N ""

# 2. Authorize its PUBLIC key on the droplet
ssh-copy-id -i ./olx_deploy_key.pub <user>@<droplet-host>
#   (or append olx_deploy_key.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys manually)

# 3. Put the PRIVATE key into the DO_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY secret
cat ./olx_deploy_key      # copy the whole output, incl. BEGIN/END lines

# 4. Ensure the droplet has Docker + the Compose v2 plugin. A non-root DO_USER
#    must be able to run docker:  sudo usermod -aG docker <user>
#    (No .env to create — the app secrets above are injected by the deploy.)
```

Then push to `main` (or trigger **Actions → CI / Deploy → Run workflow**). Watch
it under the repo's **Actions** tab; the health-check step surfaces app logs if
the container fails to start (e.g. a bad `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`).

> **Note:** commit `package-lock.json` — `npm ci` (and its cache) require it.

## Known limitations / next steps

- **Real OLX parsing needs tuning** against the live site (selectors/params/location
  slugs). Start on `mock`, switch to `http`, iterate. The interface means this
  won't ripple into the rest of the app.
- **No price *history***, by design — only current-vs-last-seen is compared. Full
  trend history is the trigger to add a time-series store (SQLite/Postgres) later.
- **Profile editing** in `/mysearches` is Pause/Resume/Delete for v1; to change
  filters, delete and re-run `/newsearch`.
- **In-memory wizard session** — an interrupted `/newsearch` (e.g. bot restart
  mid-wizard) is simply restarted; saved profiles are unaffected (they're in Redis).
